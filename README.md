## üõ†Ô∏è Installation Guide

Follow these steps to get `jobxp` up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js (v14 or higher) and npm (or yarn) installed.

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the `jobxp` repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/m88deng/jobxp.git
cd jobxp
```

### 2. Backend Setup (Server)

Navigate to the `server` directory, install dependencies, and set up environment variables.

```bash
cd server
npm install # or yarn install
```

Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory based on a `.env.example` (if provided, otherwise create one manually) and fill in your configuration details (e.g., database connection strings, API keys).

```env
# Example .env content for server
PORT=5000
DATABASE_URL="your_database_connection_string"
JWT_SECRET="your_secret_key"
```

### 3. Frontend Setup (Client)

Navigate to the `client` directory, install dependencies, and configure your environment.

```bash
cd ../client # Go back to root, then into client
npm install # or yarn install
```

Similarly, create a `.env` file in the `client` directory and add any necessary environment variables, such as the API endpoint for your backend.

```env
# Example .env content for client
REACT_APP_API_URL="http://localhost:3000/api"
```

### 4. Running the Application

After setting up both client and server, you can start them independently.

#### Start the Backend Server

From the `server` directory:

```bash
npm start # or yarn start
```

The server will typically run on `http://localhost:5000`.

#### Start the Frontend Client

From the `client` directory:

```bash
npm start # or yarn start
```

The client application will usually open in your browser at `http://localhost:5173`.


## üí° Usage Examples

Once the server and client are running, you can access the application through your web browser.

### Basic Navigation

1.  **Register/Login:** Create a new account or log in with existing credentials.
2.  **Track Job Application:** Instantly extract metadata of a job posting and store in your job application tracker.
3.  **View Job Details:** Click on an existing application to see its full description, requirements, and company information.
